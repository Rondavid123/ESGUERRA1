<h2>GAME OVERVIEW </h2>
<li> Gran Turismo 7 is a sim racing video game released in 2022 by Sony Interactive Entertainment and developed by Polyphony Digital. The game is the eighth mainline installment in the Gran Turismo series. It was announced on June 11, 2020 at the PlayStation 5 reveal event and released on March 4, 2022 for PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5.
<br />
<br />
<li> A dizzying selection of game modes, including fan favorites like GT Campaign, Arcade, and Driving School, will help you find your niche whether you're a competitive or recreational racer, collector, tuner, livery designer, or photographer. With the return of the venerable GT Simulation Mode, you may once again buy, tweak, and race your way through an enjoyable solo campaign while also unlocking additional vehicles and tasks. And if you enjoy competing against others, sharpen your abilities and take part in the GT Sport Mode.
<br />
<br />
<li> The gameÂ recreates the look and feel of classic motors and cutting-edge supercars alike in unparalleled detail, with over 420 cars available at Brand Central and the Used Car Dealership from the start. As you navigate over 90 track routes in dynamic weather conditions, including classic courses from GT history, each car handles differently and feels unique.

 <h2>GAMEPLAY </h2>
<li> The GT Simulation Mode single-player campaign is back in Gran Turismo 7. Along with the new GT Sport Mode, Brand Central, and Discover that were added in Gran Turismo Sport, other returning elements include the return of conventional racing circuits and vehicles, Special Events, Championships, Driving School, Tuning Parts Shop, Used Cars shop, and GT Auto. To gain access to features like multiplayer, all tracks, and automobiles, the player must complete tasks (referred to as "Menu Books") from the GT Cafe.
 <br />
 <br />
<li> Dynamic time and weather effects, which first featured in Gran Turismo 5 and Gran Turismo 6, are also present in the game. Like Gran Turismo Sport, the game has a single-player campaign, however in order for players to be able to save their progress, they must always have an online connection. This choice, according to the series' creator Kazunori Yamauchi, was chosen to stop cheating and hacking. However, the arcade mode can be played entirely offline.
 <br />
 <br />
 <li> In order to support features like advanced haptic feedback, adaptive triggers, real-time ray tracing effects, 3D spatial audio, and faster loading times, the PlayStation 5 version of the game makes use of the console's increased processing power, dedicated ray-tracing hardware, custom solid-state drive storage, Tempest Engine, and DualSense controller. Gran Turismo 7 for the PlayStation 5 also supports high dynamic range and operates at 4K resolution and 60 frames per second.

 <h2>DEVELOPMENT AND RELEASE </h2>
<li> Yamauchi confirmed that there will be a focus on fine tuning the classic GT experience in a July 2019 interview with GTPlanet, a fan website devoted to the Gran Turismo series. Yamauchi added: "I think the next title that we're going to create will be a combination of the past, present, and future - a complete form of Gran Turismo."

<li> On June 11, 2020, Gran Turismo 7 was unveiled at Sony's PlayStation 5 announcement stream. For the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5, the game is being created by Polyphony Digital and published by Sony Interactive Entertainment. The game's initial release date was set for 2021. Due to how the COVID-19 pandemic affected the video game industry and game development, it was subsequently postponed to 2022. On March 4, 2022, the game was made available for PS4 and PS5 systems. Lewis Hamilton, a seven-time F1 world driver's champion, returns to the series as the "maestro" from Gran Turismo Sport.

 <br />
 <li> Gran Turismo 7 was taken off the market in Russia on the day it was released, even though Sony hadn't made a formal decision at the time. Gran Turismo 7 sales in Russia were to be discontinued on March 9, 2022, four days after the game's release, in retaliation to the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, according to a PlayStation announcement.
