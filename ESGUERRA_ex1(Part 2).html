<h2>Venture into a car-themed resort </h2>
With GT7, the series will once again feature the beloved World Map. This time, it takes the shape of a resort where players may relax and enjoy their car life while also using it as a menu to quickly access the game's different functions. Players will purchase a compact car with their first set of credits in this planet. From there, they will progress by taking on challenges in the form of competitions and other events in order to get faster automobiles and awards. As they advance through the game, they will also be able to tune and enhance their original cars to make them faster. Players can travel to the car resort to learn more about the vehicle and its history while parking their vehicles at the "Garage" as a home base.
<br />
<hr size=2 noshade>
<h2>Tracks from 34 locations with 97 layouts </h2>
For GT7, there are now more tracks available to choose from as the setting for all the racing action. The tracks in GT7 include 97 different layouts and are located in 34 different places, maintaining the customary mix of real-life and original circuits. With the most recent technology, vintage series circuits like Trial Mountain, Deep Forest, and High Speed Ring are making a comeback. Future upgrades will also include the addition of more tracks.
<br />
<hr size=2 noshade>
<h2>The Café: A place to discover car history and culture </h2>
Players can pick up Menu Books at the café, which contain missions that direct them across the resort's several places. The Menu Book, which helps players accumulate cars, is the focal point of the GT7 experience. Players can hear a curated explanation of their newly purchased automobiles after finishing a book, and occasionally they can even meet the designers who worked on them! Through the Menu Books, the game is set up so that players can interact in a natural way with the history and culture of the vehicle.
<br />
<hr size=2 noshade>
 <h2>Three Car Dealerships </h2>
In the game, cars may be acquired from car dealerships. Depending on their goals, GT7 players will use one of three dealerships to advance through the game. Brand Central is one of these dealerships, where you may find cars made in 2001 and later. There are roughly 300 cars available, and under each brand's specific Museum section, gamers can read more about each car's past. Players can buy used cars at the Used Car Dealership for less money than brand-new vehicles. Nevertheless, some models, like Japanese sports vehicles from the 1990s, fetch premium prices that are typically much higher than their original sticker prices. Every day updates are expected to the used automobile roster. The Legendary Car Dealership, which sells iconic and rare cars with a high historical value, is the last option.

<h2>World Circuits: Visit and race on the world's greatest tracks</h2>
 The tracks from GT7 are accessible to gamers through World Circuits. From here, they can go to several circuits and participate in events like races and competitions there.

<h2>License Center and Missions </h2>
The GT7 experience is mostly comprised of multiple races, but there are other enjoyable activities included in the game, such as those available at the License Center. This mode functions as a driving school where players may execute brief time trial challenges to gain Gold rewards and advance their driving skills.

 <h2>Multiplayer feature allows you to enjoy racing with family and friends </h2>
For participating in races with other players, there are numerous features. Players can race their loved ones in their living rooms using the two-player split-screen mode, and they can even play online in the Lobby. Racing in the sport mode is quite competitive. Additionally, Meeting Places, a new addition to the series, offer lobbies in a more relaxed setting.

<h2>The Tuning Shop, GT Auto, and Livery Editor let you personalize your cars</h2>
You can modify a car's appearance at GT Auto to suit your desires. Additionally, it provides services like car repair and car washing. In addition to more than 1200 real paint colors based on actual paint samples, there are more than 650 aero parts, 130+ wheels, and other options available. With so many customization options, roll cages and even wide body kits with overfenders may be installed, depending on the vehicle.

<h2>Scapes and Race Photos awaken the photographer in you </h2>
In the Scapes option, gamers can take unforgettable pictures of their favorite automobiles while exploring different parts of the globe. Each "Spot" in the collection of more than 2500 locations was photographed using HDR technology. You'll not only shoot elaborate images that are nearly difficult to take in real life, but you'll also learn about the art of photography with actual light expressions and many effects that allow a wide range of flexibility in expression.

<h2>Music Replay: Switching cameras dynamically to match the music </h2>
Replays have been a key component of the Gran Turismo series since the very beginning. The high-quality replays are still available in GT7, but the recently created Music Replay has substantially improved. The Music Replay automatically generates camera placements and edits to match the music, in contrast to typical replays where cameras are put on the circuit in advance and follow the cars. Every time you watch, a new replay is available.
